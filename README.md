## Characters
Unlike normal chess, pieces in Tactical Chess can move in all directions. However, their attacks are based on their chess movements. For instance, pawns and bishops can only attack diagonally, while a knight piece attacks in an L shape.

### Pawn

### Rook

### Bishop

### Knight
Knights have a higher movement range on flat terrain, but struggle in hills. They can only attack in an L-Shaped pattern.

### King

### Queen


## Weapons

### Melee

### Ranged

#### Magic
In Tactical Chess, there are two kinds of magic; **Dark Magic** and **Blood Magic**, like the Black and Red squares on the chess board. **Kings** and **Bishops** are the only two pieces that can perform magic attacks, depending on their class path. 

Magic attacks are **only** ranged; they cannot target enemies directly adjacent to them.
